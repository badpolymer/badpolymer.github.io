   - Whether muting or managing video cameras, our application empowers users to tailor their video calling experience to their preferences.


## Development Process

- **Role:** Led the development team and actively contributed to the analysis, design, and implementation.
- **Challenges:** Faced challenges and successfully addressed them through collaborative problem-solving.
  1. Time Management

     Balancing the project requirements with concurrent coursework demanded efficient time management. Juggling multiple courses simultaneously required strategic planning to ensure the successful completion of all tasks within deadlines.

  2. Learning Curve for New Technologies

     Adapting to new technologies such as WebRTC, Socket.IO, TypeScript, and Docker presented a learning curve. Overcoming this challenge involved continuous learning, exploring documentation, and seeking guidance from mentors and teammates.

  3. Health Setback

     A significant hurdle emerged when I faced a week-long illness during the project timeline. This unexpected health setback disrupted the workflow and necessitated a reassessment of project timelines. Despite this challenge, effective communication with the team helped manage expectations and redistribute responsibilities to ensure project continuity.

  4. Diverse Skill Levels Among Teammates

     The project team comprised individuals with varying skill levels and expertise. Bridging the gap between team members with different levels of familiarity with the technologies posed a communication and collaboration challenge. Implementing effective knowledge-sharing strategies, such as pair programming and mentorship, became essential to maintain a cohesive and productive team dynamic.
